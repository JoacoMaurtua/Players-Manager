# MANAGE PLAYERS

Create a 'Team Manager' app that manages your team roster and RSVP for a series of 3 games. Specifically, we should be able to add and remove players. We should also be able to see each player's status of 'Play', 'Don't play' and 'Undecided' for each of the 3 games. More details are included in the wireframe below. Make sure to read the following tasks to understand which features are bonuses.
